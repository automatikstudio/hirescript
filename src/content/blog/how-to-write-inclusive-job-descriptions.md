# How to Write Inclusive Job Descriptions That Attract Diverse Talent

Your job description is your first conversation with potential candidates. And here's the problem: **most job descriptions are unintentionally exclusive.** They use language that signals "not for you" to women, minorities, older workers, and people with disabilities — even when that's not your intent.

The result? You miss out on talented candidates who self-select out before applying. Your hiring pool shrinks. Your team stays homogeneous.

This guide shows you how to write job descriptions that welcome everyone who's qualified — and why it matters for your business.

## Why Inclusive Job Descriptions Matter

This isn't just about being nice. It's about results:

- **Diverse teams outperform** — McKinsey found companies with diverse leadership are 36% more likely to outperform on profitability
- **You access more talent** — Exclusive language cuts your candidate pool significantly
- **Retention improves** — Employees who feel welcomed from day one stay longer
- **Innovation increases** — Different perspectives solve problems differently

An inclusive job description is a competitive advantage.

## Common Biased Language (And What to Use Instead)

### Gendered Language

Words have associations, even when they seem neutral.

**Masculine-coded words** (shown to discourage women from applying):
- Aggressive → *Ambitious*, *driven*
- Competitive → *Achievement-oriented*
- Dominant → *Leadership skills*
- Ninja/Rockstar/Guru → *Expert*, *specialist*
- He/his (default) → *They/their* or alternate he/she

**Feminine-coded words** (may discourage men):
- Nurturing → *Supportive*
- Collaborative (overused) → Balance with outcome-focused language

**Fix:** Run your job description through a gender decoder tool. Aim for balance.

### Age-Biased Language

These phrases screen out older workers:

- "Digital native" → *Proficient with digital tools*
- "Young and dynamic team" → *Energetic team*
- "Recent graduate" → *Entry-level* (if experience isn't actually required)
- "1-3 years experience" → Ask: Is this actually necessary, or just a proxy for salary expectations?
- "Cultural fit" → *Values alignment* (and be specific about which values)

**Fix:** Focus on skills and capabilities, not proxies for age.

### Ability-Biased Language

Don't exclude disabled candidates unnecessarily:

- "Must be able to lift 50 lbs" → Only if actually required. If so, specify frequency
- "Walking and standing required" → Only if true. Many jobs assume this but don't require it
- "Must have reliable transportation" → *Must be able to commute reliably* (they might use public transit or ride-sharing)
- "Fast-paced environment" → Can signal inaccessibility. Be specific about what you mean

**Fix:** List only genuine physical requirements. Mention accommodation willingness.

### Cultural and Background Bias

- "Native English speaker" → *Fluent in English* (written, verbal, or both — be specific)
- "US-based candidates only" → If not legally required, omit it
- "Ivy League preferred" → Do you actually need the pedigree, or the skills?
- "Professional appearance" → Too vague and subjective. If dress code matters, be specific

**Fix:** Focus on skills and outcomes, not backgrounds.

## The Inclusive Job Description Framework

### 1. Start with an Inclusive Opening

Set the tone immediately:

**Instead of:**
"[Company] is seeking a rockstar developer to join our young, fast-paced team..."

**Try:**
"[Company] is looking for a skilled developer to join our growing team. We value diverse perspectives and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply."

### 2. Separate Requirements vs. Nice-to-Haves

Most candidates (especially women) only apply when they meet 100% of qualifications. Men apply at 60%.

Split your qualifications into:
- **Required:** Genuine must-haves (skills you can't train)
- **Nice-to-have:** Skills that would be a bonus but aren't dealbreakers

Be honest with yourself: How many "requirements" are actually preferences?

### 3. Focus on Competencies, Not Credentials

**Instead of:**
"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science required"

**Try:**
"Strong programming fundamentals (bachelor's degree, bootcamp, or equivalent self-taught experience)"

Many talented people don't have traditional credentials. Do you need the degree, or the skills?

### 4. Describe the Work, Not the Worker

**Instead of:**
"You are a self-starter who thrives under pressure..."

**Try:**
"This role involves managing multiple projects independently with competing deadlines..."

Describe what someone will DO, not who they should BE. Let candidates self-assess.

### 5. Include Your Commitment to Inclusion

Add a statement like:

"[Company] is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups."

Make it genuine, not boilerplate.

### 6. Highlight Flexible and Accessible Policies

If you have them, mention:
- Remote work options
- Flexible hours
- Parental leave
- Disability accommodations
- Mental health support
- Professional development

These attract diverse candidates who may have caregiving responsibilities or accessibility needs.
