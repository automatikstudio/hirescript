You spent weeks getting headcount approved, aligned with the hiring manager on the role, and finally posted the job description. Two weeks later? A handful of mediocre applications and a growing sense of dread.

The problem usually isn't your company, your compensation, or the job market. It's the job description itself.

Research consistently shows that **the average job seeker spends less than 30 seconds** scanning a job posting before deciding whether to apply. In that tiny window, a single red flag can send top talent clicking away — straight to your competitor's listing.

Here are 10 job description mistakes that silently repel great candidates, and exactly how to fix each one.

## 1. Using Vague or Inflated Job Titles

"Marketing Ninja" and "Sales Rockstar" might feel creative, but they're invisible to search engines and confusing to candidates. Non-standard titles also make it harder for applicants to gauge seniority and fit.

**Fix it:** Use clear, searchable titles. "Senior Marketing Manager" outperforms "Marketing Guru" every time — both in job board search results and in candidate trust.

## 2. Writing a Wall of Text

A job description that reads like a legal contract is a guaranteed application killer. Dense paragraphs, 25-bullet requirement lists, and rambling company histories overwhelm readers.

**Fix it:** Keep it scannable. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and clear section headings. Aim for **300–700 words** total — enough to inform, not enough to exhaust.

## 3. Listing Too Many Requirements

Studies from Hewlett-Packard famously found that **women apply to jobs when they meet 100% of the qualifications, while men apply at 60%**. Every unnecessary requirement you add disproportionately filters out diverse, qualified candidates.

**Fix it:** Separate "must-haves" from "nice-to-haves." Be honest about what's truly required versus what can be learned on the job. Five to seven core requirements is the sweet spot.

## 4. Forgetting to Include Salary Information

In an era of pay transparency laws and candidate expectations, omitting compensation is one of the fastest ways to lose applicants. A LinkedIn survey found that **salary is the #1 thing candidates want to see** in a job posting.

**Fix it:** Include a salary range. If you can't share exact numbers, at least provide a band. Listings with compensation data consistently receive **30% or more applications** than those without.

## 5. Using Gendered or Exclusionary Language

Words like "aggressive," "dominant," and "rockstar" skew masculine and can unconsciously discourage women and non-binary candidates from applying. Similarly, phrases like "young and energetic" signal age bias.

**Fix it:** Run your description through a bias checker. Replace gendered language with neutral alternatives: "collaborative" instead of "aggressive," "driven" instead of "dominant." Tools like [HireScript](/) automatically flag and suggest bias-free alternatives.

## 6. Focusing Only on What You Want

Too many job descriptions are entirely one-sided: here's what we need, here's what you must do, here are our standards. They forget that hiring is a two-way street.

**Fix it:** Dedicate a section to what the candidate *gets* — growth opportunities, team culture, interesting problems they'll solve, benefits, and flexibility. Answer the candidate's real question: "Why should I want this job?"

## 7. Being Vague About Work Arrangement

"Flexible work environment" could mean anything from fully remote to "you can leave at 4:30 on Fridays." In a post-pandemic world, candidates want clarity on where and when they'll work.

**Fix it:** State it explicitly. Is this role remote, hybrid (how many days?), or on-site? Include the location and any time zone requirements. Clarity here prevents wasted time for everyone.

## 8. Burying or Skipping the Application Process

Candidates who don't know what happens after they click "Apply" are more likely to abandon the process entirely. A mysterious black hole of "we'll be in touch" erodes trust.

**Fix it:** Include a brief note on what to expect: "You'll hear back within 5 business days" or "Our process includes a phone screen, a skills assessment, and a final interview." Transparency signals a respectful, well-organized company.

## 9. Copying the Same Template for Every Role

Using identical boilerplate for a senior engineer and an entry-level coordinator tells candidates you don't actually understand — or care about — the specific role. It also hurts your SEO since duplicate content gets deprioritized by search engines and job boards.

**Fix it:** Tailor each posting to the specific role. Highlight what makes *this* position unique. Mention the team they'll join, the projects they'll work on, and the specific impact they'll have.

## 10. Not Proofreading

Typos, broken formatting, and grammatical errors in a job description send a clear message: "We don't pay attention to detail — and we don't respect your time enough to get this right."

**Fix it:** Have at least one other person review the posting before it goes live. Read it aloud. Better yet, use an AI writing tool that catches errors and inconsistencies before they reach candidates.

## The Bigger Picture

Every one of these mistakes has the same root cause: **treating job descriptions as an afterthought** instead of what they really are — your first impression with the best people in your industry.

The companies that consistently attract top talent don't just write job descriptions. They craft compelling, honest, inclusive invitations to work together. And they make every word count.
